== Just Try It

As the previous page described, sometimes applications rely on client-side controls to control access (obscurity). If you can find items which are invisible, just try them and see what happens. Yes, it can be that simple!

=== Gathering User Info

Often data dumps originate from vulnerabilities such as sql injection, but they can also come from poor or lacking access control.

It will likely take multiple steps and multiple attempts to get this one. Pay attention to the comments and leaked info. And you'll need to do some guessing too.  You may need to use another browser/account along the way.  Start with the info you already gathered (hidden menu items) to see if you can pull the list of users and then provide the 'Hash' for your own user account.
