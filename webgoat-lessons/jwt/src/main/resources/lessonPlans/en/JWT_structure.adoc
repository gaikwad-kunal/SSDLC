== Structure of a JWT token

Let's take a look at the structure of a JWT token.

The token is base64-url-encoded and consists of three parts `header.claims.signature`. 

Based on the algorithm the signature will be added to the token. This way you can verify that someone did not modify the token (one change to the token will invalidate the signature).

You can use the below forms as a simple way to encode and decode JWT tokens. Or you can make use of the more extensive options at https://jwt.io[jwt.io,window=_blank].
You can revisit this page for the assignments to come and use it as part of your attempts to solve it.
