== The Network tab

In the Network tab you can view HTTP requests and responses the website has performed.
If you want more detailed information on a particular request, just click on it.
In the Timeline above the blue dots represent when these requests and responses have been performed.
You can also see the Requests done in a specific time frame, simply by clicking and dragging on the timeline. Now the window
below, will only show the requests and responses done in that particular time frame.
