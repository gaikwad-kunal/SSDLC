== The Console tab

In the console tab you can see anything, which a loaded JavaScript file may have printed out to it.
Do not worry if you see something in red. While that is an error, it has probably resolved itself.
Through the console tab, it is also possible for you to run your own line of JavaScript code.

Start by clearing console using the shortcut `CTRL+L`.

To run your own JavaScript, simply click inside of the console and write something like:
`console.log("Hello WebGoat!");` Hit enter. Hello WebGoat should now appear in your console.
The console also allows you to do some basic arithmetic. If you type for example `1+3` and hit
enter the console should display 4.

Note: You may see an `undefined` in the console. You can safely  ignore this statement,
it only means, that the JavaScript function you have called did not return anything, therefore `undefined`.
