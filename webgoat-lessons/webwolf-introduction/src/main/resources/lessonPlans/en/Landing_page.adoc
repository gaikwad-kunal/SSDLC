== Landing page

This page will show all the requests made to '/landing/**'. This means
you can use WebWolf as your landing page for harvesting cookies etc which
is helpful when you perform a XSS lesson.

*For this exercise you need to login to WebWolf first.*

Suppose we tricked a user to click on a link he/she received in an email, this link will open up our crafted
password reset link page. The user does not notice any differences compared to the normal password reset page of the company.
The user enters a new password and hits enter. The new password will be sent to your host. In this case the new
password will be sent to WebWolf. Try to locate the unique code.

Please be aware that after resetting the password the user will receive an error page. In a real attack scenario the
user would probably see a normal success page (this is due to a limit what we can control with WebWolf)
