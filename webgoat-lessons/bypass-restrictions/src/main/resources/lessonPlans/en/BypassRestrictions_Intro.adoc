== Concept

Users have a great degree of control over the front-end of the web application.
They can alter HTML code, sometimes also scripts. This is why
apps that require certain format of input should also validate on server-side.

== Goals

* The user should have a basic knowledge of HTML
* The user should be able to tamper a request before sending (with proxy or other tool)
* The user will be able to tamper with field restrictions and bypass client-side validation
