== Prevent

To prevent SSRF vulnerabilities in web applications, it is recommended to adhere to the following guidelines:

* Use a whitelist of allowed domains, resources and protocols from where the web server can fetch resources.
* Any input accepted from the user should be validated and rejected if it does not match the positive specification expected.
* If possible, do not accept user input in functions that control where the web server can fetch resources.
