== Compromising Availability
After successfully compromising confidentiality and integrity in the previous lessons, we now are going to compromise the third element of the CIA triad: *availability*.

There are many different ways to violate availability.
If an account is deleted or the password gets changed, the actual owner cannot access it anymore.
Attackers could also try to delete parts of the database making it useless or even dropping the whole database.
Another way to compromise availability would be to per example revoke access-rights from admins or any other users, so that nobody gets access to (specific parts of) the database.

=== It is your turn!
Now you are the top earner in your company.
But do you see that?
There seems to be a *access_log* table, where all your actions have been logged to! +
Better go and _delete it_ completely before anyone notices.
