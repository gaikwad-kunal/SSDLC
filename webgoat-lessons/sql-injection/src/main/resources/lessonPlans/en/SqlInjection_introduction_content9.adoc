== Compromising Integrity with Query chaining
After compromising the confidentiality of data in the previous lesson, this time we are gonna compromise the *integrity*
of data by using SQL *query chaining*.

The integrity of any data can be compromised, if an attacker per example changes information that he should not even be
able to access.

=== What is SQL query chaining?
Query chaining is exactly what it sounds like. When query chaining, you try to append one or more queries to the end of
the actual query. You can do this by using the *;* metacharacter which marks the end of a query and that way allows to
start another one right after it within the same line.

=== It is your turn!
You just found out that Tobi and Bob both seem to earn more money than you!
Of course you cannot leave it at that. +
Better go and _change your own salary so you are earning the most!_
