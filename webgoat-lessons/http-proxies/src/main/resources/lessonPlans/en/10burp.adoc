== Burp

Another proxy that is used a lot is Burp. One of the exercises in WebGoat can only be resolved with Burp and not yet with OWAP ZAP.
Burp can only be configured manually, please follow the steps described link:start.mvc#lesson/HttpProxies.lesson/8[here] first.
Burp community edition can be downloaded as a plain jar file https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload[Burp download,window=_blank]

	 java -jar burpsuite_community_v2.1.04.jar
	 
Ignore the warning on using JDK11.
Choose `temporary project`, followed by `use burp defaults`.

Go to the proxy options and change it to use port 8090

Go to the proxy intercept page and click on the toggle so that intercept is switched off. (By default nd in the picture below it is switched on)

The start a browser connected to the proxy and start using WebGoat.
Now adjust the intercept request setting by extending the rule on what not to intercept:

Use e.g.: (\^mvc$|^txt$|\^woff$|^lesson$|\^gif$|^jpg$|\^png$|^css$|\^js$|^ico$)
Then enable the intercept by click on the earlier mentioned toggle.

An intercept will look like:
