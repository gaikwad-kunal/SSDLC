=== Use the "Edit and resend" functionality in ZAP

Another way to send a request again instead of clicking in WebGoat on a button and intercept the request there is also
an option to resend the same request again from within ZAP.
This may significantly help you to solve an assignment because you do not have to switch to ZAP enable the intercept button
and go back to WebGoat and perform the request again from within the browser.

Let's look at an example, we are going to use the e-mail example from the WebWolf introduction lesson. This lesson
will generate a request for `/WebGoat/WebWolf/mail`, in the "History" window select the URL you want to resend right click
on the URL and select `Open/Resend with Request Editor`. You can also find the request in the left pane of ZAP as indicated
with the red arrow in the image below:

A new window will open and here you can modify the request for example change the e-mail address to someone else and send it again.
In the response tab you can inspect the response of the request. In some assignments the response will show a solved message
but sometimes you get a code/flag which you need to submit in WebGoat in order to complete the assignment. Always be on the
lookout for the response. If you solved the assignment by make a request in this way WebGoat will automatically mark
the lesson as solved.
