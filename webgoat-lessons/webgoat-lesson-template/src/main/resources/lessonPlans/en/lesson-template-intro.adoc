This lesson describes the steps needed to add a new lesson to WebGoat. In general there are four steps:

- Write the content, in WebGoat we use AsciiDoc as a format.
- Create a lesson class
- Write html glue page so WebGoat knows how the content should be displayed
- Add one or more assignments within the lesson

Let's see how to create a new lesson.
