== Step 1: writing content

Each lesson can consist of multiple pages with content (text) to explain the vulnerability at hand. The content
is written in AsciiDoc[https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/] which makes it very easy to write content (if you know Markdown you know asciidoc).

You can find excellent tutorials online for the asciidoc syntax we are just showing a basic overview below.
Below we will describe some of the constructs which are quite often used within WebGoat.

=== Sub-heading

Check asciidoc for syntax, but more = means smaller headings.  You can *bold* text and other things.

=== Structuring files

You should set up all content so that it is these *.adoc files. The asciidoc files should be place in the
directory `{lesson}/src/main/resources/lessonPlans/en` the last part depends on the locale.

=== Images

Images can be referenced as below including setting style (recommended to use lesson-image as the style). The root is `{lesson}/src/main/resources/images`

image::images/firefox-proxy-config.png[Firefox Proxy Config,510,634,style="lesson-image"]

=== Code block

Code blocks can be written as follows:

```
[source]
----
public class A {

  private String test;
}
----
```
